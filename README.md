## ✨ Features

### 📖 Reading Speed Test (MNREAD-Style)
- Measures reading speed in **Words Per Minute (WPM)**
- Calculates **Critical Print Size (CPS)** - smallest size for comfortable reading
- Calculates **Threshold Print Size (TPS)** - absolute smallest readable size
- Uses **voice recognition** to automatically time your reading
- Full chart display from **8M to 0.4M** print sizes

### 🔲 Contrast Sensitivity Test (Pelli-Robson Style)
- 5-letter lines at **7 contrast levels** (100% to 1.25%)
- Based on clinical **Pelli-Robson** standards
- Passing criteria: **4 out of 5 letters** correct
- Measures **log Contrast Sensitivity (log CS)**
- Normal range: 1.5-2.0 log CS

### 🌈 Color Vision Test (Ishihara-Style)
- **Pseudo-isochromatic plates** for red-green deficiency screening
- Based on **Ishihara test** methodology
- Uses **confusion lines** for protan/deutan detection
- Screens for color vision deficiencies

### 👁️ Additional Tests
- **Distance Visual Acuity** - Tumbling E optotypes
- **Amsler Grid** - Macular function screening

## 🎯 Test Details

### Reading Speed (MNREAD)
- **10-word sentences** per line (clinical standard)
- **Print sizes:** 8M to 0.4M (Snellen 20/1600 to 20/80)
- **Viewing distance:** 40cm (16 inches)
- **Calculation:** WPM = 60 × (10 - errors) / time_seconds
- **CPS:** Smallest size at maximum reading speed
- **TPS:** Smallest readable size

### Contrast Sensitivity (Pelli-Robson)
- **5 letters per line** (Sloan letters: C, D, H, K, N, O, R, S, V, Z)
- **Contrast levels:** 100%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, 2.5%, 1.25%
- **Passing score:** 4/5 letters correct
- **Scoring:** If 2 errors on a line, previous line is result
- **Normal range:** 1.5-2.0 log CS

### Color Vision (Ishihara-Style)
- **Pseudo-isochromatic plates** (dots with equal brightness)
- **Confusion lines** for protan/deutan screening
- **Control plates** (everyone should see)
- **Screening plates** (color deficient may miss)
- **Normal score:** 12+ correct out of 15 plates
